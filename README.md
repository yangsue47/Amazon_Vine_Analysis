## Summary
Based on how high of a percentage the number of 5 stars were for Vine members, there is a positive bais towards the review. More than half of paid Vine members had 5 star ratings versus less than 40% of non-paid Vine members. This clearly shows that paid members have a more positive view of Video Games than those who don't pay. Rather than analyzing data this way, a recommendation can be to do a statistical distribution looking at all star ratings for skewness.
